abstract = {Additive manufacturing, often known as 3D printing, is a type of digital fabrication technique that builds physical items from a geometrical model through the addition of materials. The field of 3D printing is one that is rapidly expanding. 3D printing has been a common practice around the world in recent years. Mass customization and manufacture of open-source designs are becoming increasingly common uses of 3D printing in the agricultural, healthcare, automotive, and locomotive industries. Using a CAD model as a starting point, 3D printing technology can build a three-dimensional object layer by layer. This paper provides an overview of the different types of 3D printing techniques, Classification, Materials used, & their applications in various sectors.}

abstract = {Nowadays, additive manufacturing (AM) is a widely used technology with many applications in different industries and research fields. This is due to the numerous benefits of this technology in manufacturing, design, and distribution to customers. Design freedom, flexibility, high customization, and waste minimization are the principle advantages of this technology among many others. Besides, AM is considered as a sustainable production method compared to the conventional processes. In fact, it has many sustainability benefits in production design, quality, and optimization. This chapter discusses the sustainability dimensions of the AM processes in product design and investigates the AM impacts in economic, environmental, and social segments. Moreover, the sustainability assessment methods, such as life cycle assessment, and the low cost models and standards are reported based on various studies.}

abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) is currently a frequently discussed topic in the industry, with promising benefits for the development and manufacturing of high-value products. This paper aims to investigate and structure the application purposes of additive manufacturing, especially Laser-based Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), showing the benefits of and additional values created by the technology. Therefore a concept of “Enablers and Objectives” linked to the use of AM is developed. Based on this concept, 128 use cases from industry applications are investigated. The main finding is the relevance of AM benefits in industry applications. Currently there are two main application purposes of the AM technology: The improvement of a part’s performance and a simplified manufacturing process.}

abstract = {While additive manufacturing applications are progressing from rapid prototyping to the production of end-use products, the environmental impacts caused by these manufacturing processes and related material flows are still a rather open question. Therefore, this paper will provide an overview of available life cycle inventory data and compare the environmental impact caused by a series of additive manufacturing processes: selective laser melting, selective laser sintering, electron beam melting, fused deposition modelling and stereolithography. Next to the energy and resource consumption of the AM unit processes itself, also the impact caused during the (powder) material production and part post treatment are addressed. From environmental perspective it is clear that the additionally generated impacts during manufacturing should be compensated by functional improvements during the use phase of the AM manufactured part. As example, the case of lightweight components is discussed.}

abstract={The Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes open the possibility to go directly from Computer-Aided Design (CAD) to a physical prototype. These prototypes are used as test models before it is finalized as well as sometimes as a final product. Additive Manufacturing has many advantages over the traditional process used to develop a product such as allowing early customer involvement in product development, complex shape generation and also save time as well as money. Additive manufacturing also possess some special challenges that are usually worth overcoming such as Poor Surface quality, Physical Properties and use of specific raw material for manufacturing. To improve the surface quality several attempts had been made by controlling various process parameters of Additive manufacturing and also applying different post processing techniques on components manufactured by Additive manufacturing. The main objective of this work is to document an extensive literature review in the general area of post processing techniques which are used in Additive manufacturing.},
