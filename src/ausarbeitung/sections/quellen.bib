abstract = {Additive manufacturing, often known as 3D printing, is a type of digital fabrication technique that builds physical items from a geometrical model through the addition of materials. The field of 3D printing is one that is rapidly expanding. 3D printing has been a common practice around the world in recent years. Mass customization and manufacture of open-source designs are becoming increasingly common uses of 3D printing in the agricultural, healthcare, automotive, and locomotive industries. Using a CAD model as a starting point, 3D printing technology can build a three-dimensional object layer by layer. This paper provides an overview of the different types of 3D printing techniques, Classification, Materials used, & their applications in various sectors.}

This is due to the numerous benefits of this technology in manufacturing, design, and distribution to customers. Design freedom, flexibility, high customization, and waste minimization are the principle advantages of this technology among many others. Besides, AM is considered as a sustainable production method compared to the conventional processes. In fact, it has many sustainability benefits in production design, quality, and optimization. This chapter discusses the sustainability dimensions of the AM processes in product design and investigates the AM impacts in economic, environmental, and social segments. Moreover, the sustainability assessment methods, such as life cycle assessment, and the low cost models and standards are reported based on various studies.}

Therefore a concept of “Enablers and Objectives” linked to the use of AM is developed. Based on this concept, 128 use cases from industry applications are investigated. The main finding is the relevance of AM benefits in industry applications. Currently there are two main application purposes of the AM technology: The improvement of a part’s performance and a simplified manufacturing process.}

Therefore, this paper will provide an overview of available life cycle inventory data and compare the environmental impact caused by a series of additive manufacturing processes: selective laser melting, selective laser sintering, electron beam melting, fused deposition modelling and stereolithography. Next to the energy and resource consumption of the AM unit processes itself, also the impact caused during the (powder) material production and part post treatment are addressed. From environmental perspective it is clear that the additionally generated impacts during manufacturing should be compensated by functional improvements during the use phase of the AM manufactured part. As example, the case of lightweight components is discussed.}

Additive Manufacturing has many advantages over the traditional process used to develop a product such as allowing early customer involvement in product development, complex shape generation and also save time as well as money. Additive manufacturing also possess some special challenges that are usually worth overcoming such as Poor Surface quality, Physical Properties and use of specific raw material for manufacturing. To improve the surface quality several attempts had been made by controlling various process parameters of Additive manufacturing and also applying different post processing techniques on components manufactured by Additive manufacturing. The main objective of this work is to document an extensive literature review in the general area of post processing techniques which are used in Additive manufacturing.},

While large-scale crystallizer design profits from many years of accumulated knowledge, traditional fabrication technologies limit the possibilities for easy and rapid lab-scale design, fabrication, and subsequently testing of crystallizer design variants. Additive manufacturing (three-dimensional (3D) printing) affords an opportunity to overcome the challenges associated with scaling down equipment using traditional fabrication technologies and materials of construction such as glass or metal alloys. Moreover, additive manufacturing provides flexibility in design and the ability to rapidly redesign and prototype novel designs, limited, perhaps, only by the suitability of available materials of construction. Surprisingly, this technology has not yet found widespread use in crystallizer design. In this contribution, we present a concept study for a 3D-printed prototype crystallizer. We discuss additive manufacturing as a tool for rapid design and fabrication of down-scaled crystallizers based upon a design using the classic Oslo-type crystallizer as a starting point. The initial crystallizer design and fabrication process, subsequent design modifications, and investigation of the crystallizer characteristics are discussed here with a view to applications in pharmaceutical continuous crystallization.}

@article{Potthoff.2023,
 abstract = {Abstract. High-strength and corrosion-resistant materials, such as the nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718, are widely used in the energy and aerospace industries. However, machining these materials results in high process forces and significant tool wear. This tool wear negatively influences the resulting surface topography. Nevertheless, the accuracy requirements for functional surfaces are extremely high. Simulation systems can be used to design these processes. However, time-consuming and cost-intensive experiments often have to be conducted to develop and parameterize the required models. To overcome this problem, an analogy test setup for in-process measurements of wear-dependent properties was developed, which allows a multi-level evaluation of the process. By combining different measurement techniques, wear-dependent process characteristics can be determined and analyzed, which is usually only possible for initial and final conditions requiring a significant measurement effort.},

Then from a manufacturing process oriented viewpoint it identifies these barriers for Laser Beam Melting (LBM) using results of a round robin test inside CIRP and the work of other research groups. It shows how those barriers may be overcome and points out research topics necessary to be addressed in the near future.},

@article{Sun.2021,
 abstract = {Rotation search and point cloud registration are two fundamental problems in robotics, geometric vision, and remote sensing, which aim to estimate the rotation and transformation between the 3D vector sets and point clouds, respectively. Due to the presence of outliers (probably in very large numbers) among the putative vector or point correspondences in real-world applications, robust estimation is of great importance. In this paper, we present Inlier searching using COmpatible Structures (ICOS), a novel, efficient, and highly robust solver for both the correspondence-based rotation search and point cloud registration problems. Specifically, we (i) propose and construct a series of compatible structures for the two problems, based on which various invariants can be established, and (ii) design time-efficient frameworks to filter out outliers and seek inliers from the invariant-constrained random sampling based on the compatible structures proposed. In this manner, even with extreme outlier ratios, inliers can be effectively sifted out and collected for solving the optimal rotation and transformation, leading to our robust solver ICOS. Through plentiful experiments over standard datasets, we demonstrated that: (i) our solver ICOS is fast, accurate, and robust against over 95{\%} outliers with nearly a 100{\%} recall ratio of inliers for rotation search and both known-scale and unknown-scale registration, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods, and (ii) ICOS is practical for use in real-world application problems including 2D image stitching and 3D object localization.},
