 abstract = {- This paper presents some various imperfections that can occur during Direct Metal Laser Sintering(DMLS) and their effects on part quality. Direct Metal Laser Sintering is one of the Additive Manufacturing (AM)technologies that enables fast production of an accurate, functional, complex shape parts and tools, without additional tooling, directly from 3D CAD model. This process is based on layer by layer manufacturing, where the fusion of the metal powder is performed by selective melting with laser beam. The laser beam moves and scans area that correspond to section of the part for the specific layer. In the DMLS the part is built layer by layer, where the process of the melting and solidification occur in small volume in relatively short time. Thanks to this kind of approach, the DMLS has much less limitations than the subtractive methods of part production. However, the production in the layers has some drawbacks, which can have a significantly influence on the part geometry, structural errors and part imperfections. Some of the advantages as well and drawback of the DMLS of metal parts has been presented in this paper.},

@article{Gardner.2023,
 abstract = {Although still in its infancy, metal additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing has now arrived at a scale suitable for use in construction. The new technology offers the potential for improved economy, sustainability, safety and productivity through greater automation, enhanced customisation, reduced material usage and reduced wastage. In this paper, a review of recent developments in metal AM in structural engineering is presented, including the latest research advances, current trends and applications in practice. Emphasis is placed on Directed Energy Deposition-arc (DED-arc) AM or wire arc AM (WAAM) since this is deemed to be the most promising technique for the requirements of the construction sector. A description of the observed material response of both steel and stainless steel WAAM elements, as well as the structural behaviour of cross-sections, members, connections and systems, is provided. The challenges surrounding the inherent geometric variability of as-built WAAM material, as well as the implications of possible anisotropy, are discussed.

Optimization and additive manufacturing go hand in hand, with the latter now enabling the former to be more readily realised in practice. Every kilogramme that can be saved by optimization reduces production times and makes additive manufacturing more economical, more sustainable and ultimately more viable. Recent examples of optimized, additively manufactured structural components are presented. Additive manufacturing is likely to complement, rather than replace existing construction methods -- with this in mind, hybrid applications, as well as opportunities for strengthening and repair, are explored. The economics and sustainability of WAAM in construction, together with the key influencing parameters, are then discussed. Finally, with a view to the future, the opportunities, outlook and challenges for the wider use of metal additive manufacturing in structural engineering, are presented.},

Next to the energy and resource consumption of the AM unit processes itself, also the impact caused during the (powder) material production and part post treatment are addressed. From environmental perspective it is clear that the additionally generated impacts during manufacturing should be compensated by functional improvements during the use phase of the AM manufactured part.

While large-scale crystallizer design profits from many years of accumulated knowledge, traditional fabrication technologies limit the possibilities for easy and rapid lab-scale design, fabrication, and subsequently testing of crystallizer design variants. Additive manufacturing (three-dimensional (3D) printing) affords an opportunity to overcome the challenges associated with scaling down equipment using traditional fabrication technologies and materials of construction such as glass or metal alloys. Moreover, additive manufacturing provides flexibility in design and the ability to rapidly redesign and prototype novel designs, limited, perhaps, only by the suitability of available materials of construction. Surprisingly, this technology has not yet found widespread use in crystallizer design. In this contribution, we present a concept study for a 3D-printed prototype crystallizer. We discuss additive manufacturing as a tool for rapid design and fabrication of down-scaled crystallizers based upon a design using the classic Oslo-type crystallizer as a starting point. The initial crystallizer design and fabrication process, subsequent design modifications, and investigation of the crystallizer characteristics are discussed here with a view to applications in pharmaceutical continuous crystallization.}

 abstract = {Abstract. High-strength and corrosion-resistant materials, such as the nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718, are widely used in the energy and aerospace industries. However, machining these materials results in high process forces and significant tool wear. This tool wear negatively influences the resulting surface topography. Nevertheless, the accuracy requirements for functional surfaces are extremely high. Simulation systems can be used to design these processes. However, time-consuming and cost-intensive experiments often have to be conducted to develop and parameterize the required models. To overcome this problem, an analogy test setup for in-process measurements of wear-dependent properties was developed, which allows a multi-level evaluation of the process. By combining different measurement techniques, wear-dependent process characteristics can be determined and analyzed, which is usually only possible for initial and final conditions requiring a significant measurement effort.},

 abstract = {Rotation search and point cloud registration are two fundamental problems in robotics, geometric vision, and remote sensing, which aim to estimate the rotation and transformation between the 3D vector sets and point clouds, respectively. Due to the presence of outliers (probably in very large numbers) among the putative vector or point correspondences in real-world applications, robust estimation is of great importance. In this paper, we present Inlier searching using COmpatible Structures (ICOS), a novel, efficient, and highly robust solver for both the correspondence-based rotation search and point cloud registration problems. Specifically, we (i) propose and construct a series of compatible structures for the two problems, based on which various invariants can be established, and (ii) design time-efficient frameworks to filter out outliers and seek inliers from the invariant-constrained random sampling based on the compatible structures proposed. In this manner, even with extreme outlier ratios, inliers can be effectively sifted out and collected for solving the optimal rotation and transformation, leading to our robust solver ICOS. Through plentiful experiments over standard datasets, we demonstrated that: (i) our solver ICOS is fast, accurate, and robust against over 95{\%} outliers with nearly a 100{\%} recall ratio of inliers for rotation search and both known-scale and unknown-scale registration, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods, and (ii) ICOS is practical for use in real-world application problems including 2D image stitching and 3D object localization.},

This paper surveys literature to map the possibilities and challenges connected to methodologies and technologies using 3D scanning for reverse engineering and production control. A case study on reverse engineering using a handheld 3D laser scanner is conducted to compare with the findings in literature. In the case study, a 3D printed component with complex internal features is 3D scanned and the point cloud is optimized before two different surface modelling techniques are tested. The dimensional errors of the output CAD design are mapped before the process and results are compared with the findings in literature. The findings of this paper show that using 3D scanning technologies for RE and PC is possible but significant challenges exists in developing accurate surface reconstruction algorithms that deals with point cloud imperfections like i.e., noise and holes. Using 3D scanning for RE purposes is found to be most suitable for components with complex geometry like free-form surfaces that are hard to measure manually.},

 abstract = {The presented engineering discipline one-off construction is characterized by a multiplicity of manual processes. As almost all modern product developments, the manufacture is based on the creation and consistent use of digital models. Quality of underlying data can vary greatly and it is not certain that digital models match the actual state of construction. This can result in the need for rework after production or installation. Especially challenging in the area of premium products, for which high quality, scarce materials are used and tight schedules are defined. If physical products are reworked, the corresponding digital models must be manually maintained. At present, attempts are being made to counteract these late adjustments by means of physical mock-ups or visual inspection of 3D scan data. Such scan data is used for automated adaptation of underlying digital models to the actual state of the physical construction. Existing Point Cloud Library functionalities were adapted and further algorithms were designed. The developed software backend was integrated into the existing software architecture. During the software development, great care was taken to ensure that the backend is based on open source content. The results show significant improvements of the data basis for the subsequent engineering activities. This will lead to a significant reduction of manual effort and rework, ensuring development cycles and even shorten delivery times. It reduces costs in the product creation process and sustainably strengthens confidence in digital models used. It has been shown that automation of design processes can have productivity-enhancing effects in one-off construction.},

 abstract = {Euclidean distance matrices (EDM) are matrices of squared distances between points. The definition is deceivingly simple: thanks to their many useful properties they have found applications in psychometrics, crystallography, machine learning, wireless sensor networks, acoustics, and more. Despite the usefulness of EDMs, they seem to be insufficiently known in the signal processing community. Our goal is to rectify this mishap in a concise tutorial. We review the fundamental properties of EDMs, such as rank or (non)definiteness. We show how various EDM properties can be used to design algorithms for completing and denoising distance data. Along the way, we demonstrate applications to microphone position calibration, ultrasound tomography, room reconstruction from echoes and phase retrieval. By spelling out the essential algorithms, we hope to fast-track the readers in applying EDMs to their own problems. Matlab code for all the described algorithms, and to generate the figures in the paper, is available online. Finally, we suggest directions for further research.},

 abstract = {STATEMENT OF PROBLEM

The accuracy of the virtual images used in digital dentistry is essential to the success of oral rehabilitation.

PURPOSE

The purpose of this systematic review was to estimate the mean accuracy of digital technologies used to scan facial, skeletal, and intraoral tissues.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

A search strategy was applied in 4 databases and in the non-peer-reviewed literature from April through June 2017 and was updated in July 2017. Studies evaluating the dimensional accuracy of 3-dimensional images acquired by the scanning of hard and soft tissues were included.

RESULTS

A total of 2093 studies were identified by the search strategy, of which 183 were initially screened for full-text reading and 34 were considered eligible for this review. The scanning of facial tissues showed deviation values ranging between 140 and 1330 \textgreek{m}m, whereas the 3D reconstruction of the jaw bone ranged between 106 and 760 \textgreek{m}m. The scanning of a dentate arch by intraoral and laboratorial scanners varied from 17 \textgreek{m}m to 378 \textgreek{m}m. For edentulous arches, the scanners showed a trueness ranging between 44.1 and 591 \textgreek{m}m and between 19.32 and 112 \textgreek{m}m for dental implant digital scanning.

CONCLUSIONS

The current digital technologies are reported to be accurate for specific applications. However, the scanning of edentulous arches still represents a challenge.},

@misc{Elaksher.2023,
 abstract = {Airborne laser scanning sensors are impressive in their ability to collect a large number of topographic points in three dimensions in a very short time thus providing a high-resolution depiction of complex objects in the scanned areas. The quality of any final product naturally depends on the original data and the methods of generating it. Thus, the quality of the data should be evaluated before assessing any of its products. In this research, a detailed evaluation of a LIDAR system is presented, and the quality of the LIDAR data is quantified. This area has been under-emphasized in much of the published work on the applications of airborne laser scanning data. The evaluation is done by field surveying. The results address both the planimetric and the height accuracy of the LIDAR data. The average discrepancy of the LIDAR elevations from the surveyed study area is 0.12 m. In general, the RMSE of the horizontal offsets is approximately 0.50 m. Both relative and absolute height discrepancies of the LIDAR data have two components of variation. The first component is a random short-period variation while the second component has a less significant frequency and depends on the biases in the geo-positioning system.},
